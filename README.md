I created this Movie app, which will be an IMDB clone created on React App. This React project will give us a list of upcoming, popular, and top-rated movies. Clicking on any movie will show us the detail page of the movie. This React app also has a carousel at the top for displaying movies as hero banners.

Technologies used:

ReactJs

React Router Dom

React Loading Skeleton

React Responsive Caraousel

Font Awesome
